:: To explain what it is, the code of batch file you see is a Command line, which only works if TDM-GCC or similar software with support can run this, also -mwindows is like a command line, which tells the Compiler that it's a GUI program, also for any rest of command line, like this, you can run this, instead of "gcc main.c resource.o -mwindows -o Calculator.exe" because it can give a error, so you must use "gcc main.c resource.o -mwindows -lcomctl32 -o Calculator.exe" so, that helps remember why I should use this, because of error compiling, so now you know? for any extras, you should understand C, also C have many compilers, like C++, but except programming languages that have their own Compiler and only 1 compiler, also Compiler would generate .exe file if you run like this command you see, also, while the code if 100% correct, like I explained, use "gcc main.c resource.o -mwindows -lcomctl32 -o Calculator.exe" to prevent any errors while compiling, so now you'll see why I use the short code project, it is not megabytes, but instead it is kilobytes, so size of the ,exe compiled program would be 530 KB(Kilobytes) and on the disk, the size is 532 KB which is 532 Kilobytes.
windres resource.rc -o resource.o
:: to understand what is windres about, it's a compiler for resource script, so when compiled, and linked into .exe file, you'll see things like menu, and any stuff  like you see.
gcc main.c resource.o -mwindows -lcomctl32 -o Calculator.exe
