# the calculator program source code
# just run the commands, or just run the batch file!
```bash
windres resource.rc -o resource.o
```
# linking it as .exe file
```
gcc main.c resource.o -mwindows -lcomctl32 -o Calculator.exe
```
# end
- this is how it works!
### just remember to run the command tools or the batch file like I told you!
